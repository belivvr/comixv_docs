title: 2. Comics and Virtual Reality (VR)

## 2.1.  Suitable VR comics genre for the VR market

- **Comics with potential IP growth and overwhelming productivity. It is suitable for VR platforms lacking content and struggling with continuous user inflow.** 
- Still images and story centered contents make it possible to run in low-spec  independent VR devices.
- Low production cost due to single artist creative system.
- Effective IP utilization with popular author and characters.
- Various genres for potential readers.
- Securely maintain continuous user inflow and high retention rate through webtoon series.

- **The initial role of Naver (internationally known as Line) and Daum webtoon was to induce revisiting of their portal sites and platforms rather than profits from webtoon itself.** 

## 2.2. Various forms of VR webtoon
- **The best value of virtual reality is immersive presence**

“All of these mediums require what we call "suspension of disbelief," because there's a translation gap between the reality of the story and our consciousness interpreting the story into our reality (Chris Milk, <i>How Virtual Reality Can Create the Ultimate Empathy Machine</i>).”

- **Enhancing the sense of realism requires a combination of various technical elements or cues. Among those elements, static monocular cues and binocular cues can be used in a still image cartoon.**

-  Normally in comics, it uses various effects—the static Monocular cues—to achieve deeper story immersion. For example, in the case of linear perspective and optics, it was a sense of reality used as an image. Relative sizes of panels and letters changed to maximize story immersion and movement, rather than simply expressing perspective.

- Rather than delivering it as it is, comics distort or exaggerate the reality to convey the emotions inherent in the story, increasing the sense of reality, which can be a big difference from other realistic VR contents.
