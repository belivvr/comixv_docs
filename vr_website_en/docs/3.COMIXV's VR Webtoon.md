&nbsp **COMIXV**, a VR comics company founded in January 2017, started its service at the <i>20th International Bucheon Painting Festival</i> in July 2017 and created a new comic grammar using continuous 360-degree images and sounds. 

We advocate a global VR platform for everyone to participate by providing a web-based VR webtoon creation environment. Further on, we provide a guide on how COMIXV creates a VR webtoon and explain the application.
